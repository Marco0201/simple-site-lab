# About
This is a simple site lab I made using only type selectors and their relationships. 
# Techs used
Html and Css
# Optimizations
I made sure to use box-sizing, floats, and max-width and max-height so that it scales appropriately.
# Lessons Learned
The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this project is that selectors have their own heirarchy and relationships in Css, also it is tricky and really inefficient to use type selectors and the float property the way I have. They have their uses, but class selectors would make this process cleaner and more efficient, not to mention that the float property is hard to use sometimes as well.
